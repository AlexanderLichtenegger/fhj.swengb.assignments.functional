# Functional Assignment

This is the first assignment for SWENGB 2015.

## Step 0

You have to fork this repository, like you did with the TutorialAssignment.

## Step 1

Change the package from 'rladstaetter' to your userId (for the
source code and the test)

## Step 2

With the help of the test and the inline documentation, implement
the given functions in the FunctionalAssignment file. You should only
change code there.

To pass the assignment, you don't need to change anything else.

If you have implemented correctly the FunctionalAssignment class, the
corresponding test will be successful.

It is highly recommended to implement your own tests however. For
this you can either add testfunctions in the FunctionalAssignmentTest
file, or write a new Testfile and run your tests there.

Have fun!
